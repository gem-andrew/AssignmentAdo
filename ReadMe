This project can register a user.
When the page opens it gives list of users instead of login because facing issue with login part.
While registering it also directs to create password page and succesfully registers the user and then redirects to home page.
Password length should match I have done that validation.
In home page, we can edit, delete and see details of user.
Edit will change the user details in database
Details will show the hidden details as well like id and date of birth which is not visible
ISSUES:
facing issues with parts where 2 tables are used at once like login and forget password, therefore the UI is ready but they are not functional
dashboard depends on login and I tried it but giving error.
Delete was working fine but now it is not because of some foriegn key issue I am not able to resolve.
how to do the password encrytpion part
BUG: 
Some users are not able to register I don't know why, 
example, I tried to register Ayush Katiyar and it didn't register, I'm not able to fix that bug.
