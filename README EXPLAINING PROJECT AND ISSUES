When the page open we are redirected to login page.
If we login with a valid user (try email - ayushKK@gmail.com , password - akdm12), if login successful we are for now directed to the page which shows list of users with a welcome message,
else we are redirected to same page saying login failed.
---------------------------------------------------------------
We can register a user.
While registering it also directs to create password page and succesfully registers the user and then redirects to home page.
Password length should match I have done that validation.
In home page, we can edit and see details of user. (Delete is not working properly)
Edit will change the user details in database
Details will show the hidden details as well like id and date of birth which is not visible
ISSUES:
Forget password part remains for now.
Delete was working fine but now it is not because of some foriegn key issue I am not able to resolve.
how to do the password encrytpion part
there was an issue where some users were not registering and when trying with different name it got registered but ids in b/w skipped.
eg,
id 1a registered
id 2 b failed 
id 3 c failed
id 4 d registered
so db was showing
1 a
4 d
coudn't retrieve the lost ids
BUG: 
Some users are not able to register I don't know why, 
example, I tried to register Ayush Katiyar and it didn't register, I'm not able to fix that bug.
